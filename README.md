## 🔎 Problem
- Fragmentation & friction across chains/UIs
- Cognitive overload (fees, routes, approvals)
- No **outcome** primitive (everything is transactions)
- Tools warn/aggregate but don’t **guarantee** safe outcomes

**People don’t want to manage transactions — they want results.**

## 🌟 Solution — NOVA (Intent → Action)
- User states intent (e.g., “Bridge 1 ETH to Solana cheapest route”)
- NOVA plans, risk-checks via Zircuit SLS, and executes via AA
- One approval → one outcome → **Outcome Receipt** (costs, route, proof)

**Why only Zircuit:**  
SLS (pre-execution enforcement) + AA (delegated execution) + zk (cheap/fast composability).

## 🏗️ Architecture (high-level)
User Intent
↓
NOVA Copilot (Planner • Estimator • Risk Filter • Explainer)
↓
Zircuit Sequencer (SLS enforcement • AA orchestration • zk settlement)
↓
Outcome Receipt (route, cost bound, audit trail)

## 🧭 User Journey (Before vs After)
**Before:** 7–12 steps, multiple UIs, risk guessing, unexpected costs.  
**After (NOVA):** 1 intent → certified plan (cost bound, safety) → 1 approval → outcome receipt.
