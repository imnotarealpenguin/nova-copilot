> **NOVA** is the Cognitive Finance Copilot on **Zircuit** that turns user intent into **guaranteed, safe, and optimized outcomes** in one click.

> **Why I should win:**  
> NOVA uniquely leverages Zircuit’s **sequencer-level security**, **account abstraction**, and **zk performance** to deliver intent-based finance that no other chain can, setting a reference standard for mass adoption.

## 🔎 Problem
- Fragmentation & friction across chains/UIs
- Cognitive overload (fees, routes, approvals)
- No **outcome** primitive (everything is transactions)
- Tools warn/aggregate but don’t **guarantee** safe outcomes

**People don’t want to manage transactions — they want results.**

## 🌟 Solution — NOVA (Intent → Action)
- User states intent (e.g., “Bridge 1 ETH to Solana cheapest route”)
- NOVA plans, risk-checks via Zircuit SLS, and executes via AA
- One approval → one outcome → **Outcome Receipt** (costs, route, proof)

**Why only Zircuit:**  
SLS (pre-execution enforcement) + AA (delegated execution) + zk (cheap/fast composability).
